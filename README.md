# Flow matching based speech enhancement

This repository builds upon a previous work, that can be found here https://github.com/sp-uhh/sgmse  

Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) is a method transforming a simple distribution to a complex distribution.  
CNF is described by Oridinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
$$ \frac{d \phi_t(x_0)}{dt} = v(t,\phi_t(x_0)) $$
